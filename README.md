## From lab to patient: how statistics shapes decisions in medicine

### Abstract

The decisions behind the medications we take are more complex than you might think. When we experience symptoms like a headache or earache, we might take over-the-counter medications or seek help from healthcare professionals. But have you ever wondered how they determine which medication to give you and how much? Before a treatment reaches your hands, many decisions are made regarding its safety and effectiveness. Statistics plays a key role in guiding these decisions. 

This talk will explore how statistics helps us to make informed choices in healthcare and medicine. I’ll discuss how researchers use statistical analysis to decide how many people are required to test a treatment in a clinical trial, to decide who those people should be, and to decide which people are allocated to which treatment. We’ll also talk about different ways we can measure how effective each treatment is, and evaluate whether it might be effective and safe for people it wasn’t tested on.  

In the talk, we’ll discuss concepts such as randomisation, control groups, and the difference between statistical and clinical significance in simple terms. You’ll see how these (sometimes complex) ideas stem from topics you might cover in school such as means, sample sizes, and correlations. This talk will highlight the role of statistics in helping healthcare professionals make decisions about treatments, dosages, and side effects. It will show how statistics helps us to make informed choices and understand the world around us better. By learning about statistics in medicine, we’ll see how useful statistics is in real life and how it impacts our health and well-being every day.
